# Hey Babes!
I made this for you so you can have a digital planner to use on your phone or computer.

## How It Works

Each text box has its own title you can enter!<br>
I know you're more organized than me, so I left the categories up to you.<br>
The text boxes under them allow you to enter any text you want!<br>
The page is also saveable! Just right-click then choose 'save as>pdf' to save and edit later!<br>
You can clear the stickers with the button in the bottom left corner.<br>
The text boxes are also adjustable, so you can change their sizes by clicking and dragging the bottom right corner!<br>
  Use dashes, bullet points, emojis, etc.<br>
  You can use the boxes as notes, lists, or mini journal entries <3<br>
  That's it, though. It's pretty basic ^u^

## Here's the Fun Part!

I made the column on the right a place where you can add cute little images!<br>
**hopefully this part works**

## I Hope You Like It!

I know I haven't been the best at giving gifts, and this is very much past your birthday,<br>
but I don't need a special occasion to make you something special.<br>
So I hope you enjoy it or at least think it's cute!<br>

### That's All Folks!

I LOVE YOU DANI YOU'RE MY EVERYTHING BBGIRL <33333
