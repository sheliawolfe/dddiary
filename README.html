  Hey Babes!
  </h1></b>
I made this for you so you can have a digital planner to use on your phone or computer.

<b><h2>
  How It Works:
  </h2></b>
Each text box has its own title you can enter!<br>
I know you're more organized than me, so I left the categories up to you.<br>
The text boxes under them allow you to enter any text you want!<br>
The page is also saveable! Just right-click then choose 'save as--pdf' to save and edit later!<br>
You can clear the stickers with the button in the bottom left corner.<br>
The text boxes are also adjustable, so you can change their sizes by clicking and dragging the bottom right corner!<br>
  Use dashes, bullet points, emojis, etc.<br>
  You can use the boxes as notes, lists, or mini journal entries<br>
  That's it, though. It's pretty basic ^u^

<b><h2>
  Here's The Fun Part!
  </h2></b>

I made the column on the right a place where you can add cute little stickers!<br>
Just click and drag a sticker anywhere on the page to place it:)<br>
They are also resizable so you can 

<b><h2>
  I Hope You Like It!
  </h2></b>

I know I haven't been the best at giving gifts, and this is very much past your birthday,<br>
but I don't need a special occasion to make you something special.<br>
So I hope you enjoy it or at least think it's cute!<br>

<b><h2>
  That's All Folks!</b></b></h2>

I LOVE YOU DANI YOU'RE MY EVERYTHING BBGIRL :))))))))
